It is good practice to create a subfolder for each controller's views.
Therefore 'Home.php' in the 'app/Controllers' folder has a folder 'Home' in the 'Views' folder.

It is also good practice to match the name of the view file to the name of the method in the controller.
Therefore the 'index()' method in 'Home.php' has a corresponding 'index.php' file in the 'Views/Home' folder.
