#Algorithms

--Clearly defined problem statement, input and output.
--The steps need to be in a very specific order.
--The steps also need to be distinct.
--The algorithm should produce a result.
--The algorithm should complete in a finite amount of time.

##Efficiency
Time - the less time an algorithm takes to complete,
the more efficient it is.
Space - the less memory an algorithm uses, the more
efficient it is.

##Binary Search
Input - a sorted list of values
Output - position in the list of the target values
or a value saying that the value does not exist

##Big O
Theoretical definition of the complexity of an algorithm
as a function of the size.
